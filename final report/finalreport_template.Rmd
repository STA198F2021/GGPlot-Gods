#Research Question:

How do measles vaccination rates vary across the country and demographics in schools?

overall vaccination status vs. state, 
overall vaccination status vs. type of school,
each type of exemption (personal, religious, and medical) vs. state
exemption vs. type of school.
To analyze vaccination and exemption rates by states, we will use spatial data to show the change in these rates across the country.
Then, we can use two-sample t-tests to test for significance of vaccination and exemption rates between different types of schools.
If there are significantly lower vaccination rates in private schools vs. other types of schools, this will support our main hypothesis.
